This section explores recursion, a fundamental programming technique in Java, where a method calls itself to solve problems.

Definition and Mechanism: Explained recursion as a method of solving problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable subproblems.

Base Case and Recursive Case: Emphasized the importance of having a base case to terminate recursion and a recursive case to move toward the base case.

Common Examples: Illustrated classic examples, such as calculating factorials, Fibonacci sequences, and solving the Tower of Hanoi problem.

Advantages and Disadvantages: Discussed the benefits of recursion, including simpler code and easier problem-solving for certain tasks, as well as its downsides, such as increased memory usage and potential stack overflow.

Practical Applications: Provided real-world applications of recursion in algorithms, such as tree traversals and searching algorithms (e.g., binary search).
